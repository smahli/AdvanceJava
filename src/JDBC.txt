JDBC
_______________

Java Database Connectivity
It is a Technology which is used to connect java apllication with Database

JDBC is an API which provides some classes and interfaces by which we can connect Java Aplication with database

JDBC APT has Two packages Java.sql and javax.sql


Java.sql
	Interface		Class
	Driver			DriverManager
	Connection		Date
	statemeny		Time
	PreparedStatement	TimeStamp
	CollableStatement	Types
	ResultSet

Javax.sql
	Interface	Classs

	Datasource	RowsetEvent
	RowSet		ConnectEvent
	RowsetListener	etc


JDBC is an abstaction which is provided by SunMicrosystems & implemented by Databases Vendors(MySQL ORACLE etc)
