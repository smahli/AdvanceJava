Data Structure 
___________________

Data Structure and Algorithm : It is the way by which we can store the data in efficient(Time and space or compelexity) way 

				Type of Data Structure 
		
		1.Primitive DataStructure        2. Non Primitive Data Structure 
							1. Linear Data Structure and 2. Non Linear Data Structure 

		1. boolean 			
		2. char
		3. byte, short,int ,long
		4.double,float 


		it can be used in applictaions like Calculators and Currency convertors 

	1.Linear Data Structure 
		1.String 
		2.Arrays 
		3.List, Set, Queue
		4. AL, LL, HS, LHS etc

	2. Non Linear Data Structure 
		1.Graph
		2.Trees

It can be used in E- Commerce Websites , Social Network Websites Banking Apps etc

Array
____________

1. Arrays can store primittive and non Primitive(Objects ) types of data 
example
	int [] a = {10,2,56,42};    primitive

	class Test{
	
	// lines of code 
	}
	
	Test[] t = {t1,t2,t3,t6};  // non primitive

2.Arrays can store only homogenius type of data 

3.Array size is fixed . we cannot increase and decrease size of array at runtime

4. Arrays are inbuilt feature of Java we have to develop algorithms 


COLLECTION FRAMEWORK
_______________________

1. It is part of Non Primitive DataStructures 
2.Collection framework can contain only non-primitive type of data
Arralist al = new Arraylist();
al.add(obj1);
al.add('z')




3.We can store heterogenius types of data 
4. We can increase or decrease size of collection at the run time;

5.collection framework is an API which provides predifined classes, interfaces and Methods
